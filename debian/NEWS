open-iscsi (2.0.873+git0.3b4b4500-10) unstable; urgency=low

  RESTARTING OF ISCSID ON UPGRADES

  On updates, iscsid is now restarted (it previously wasn't). This is
  supported and as long as the new iscsid is able log in to the
  targets again, everything will continue to work. Filesystems DO NOT
  have to be unmounted, I/O will just block for a couple of seconds
  until the connections with the targets are reestablished.

  Note that to achieve this, open-iscsi now uses two init scripts /
  systemd services:
     - iscsid starts/stops the daemon (only this is restarted when
       upgrading)
     - open-iscsi logs in and out of targets (previously also started
       the daemon)

  The previous method of keeping the old iscsid running on upgrades
  was not actually supported upstream.

  Note that due to these changes, any attempt to downgrade to version
  2.0.873+git0.3b4b4500-9 or earlier will badly break your open-iscsi
  installation.



  ROOT FILESYSTEMS ON ISCSI

  Previously, if the root filesystem was on iSCSI, open-iscsi would
  not log out of any session at shutdown. This behavior has changed,
  only the session that carries the root filesystem will be kept, all
  other sessions will be logged out. If for some reason your storage
  setup is not properly detected, you may return to the old behavior
  by setting ISCSI_ROOT_KEEP_ALL_SESSIONS_AT_SHUTDOWN=1 in
  /etc/default/open-iscsi.



  HANDLE_NETDEV=0 BEHAVIOR CHANGE

  If you are running sysvinit and have HANDLE_NETDEV=0, please note
  that this flag is now also checked at bootup, i.e. filesystems with
  _netdev will not be mounted automatically at boot anymore by
  open-iscsi. (Previously, this flag was only checked at shutdown.)
  On systemd systems, HANDLE_NETDEV is now completely ignored, as
  systemd handles mounting of network filesystems directly.



  PURGING OPEN-ISCSI

  If you purge open-iscsi, it will now remove the database in
  /etc/iscsi (it previously didn't).
